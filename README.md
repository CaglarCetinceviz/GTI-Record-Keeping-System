# GTI - Record Keeping System
This repo contains my graduation project for GTI Advanced Software Development, you can make the pull requests from the [master branch](https://github.com/CaglarCetinceviz/GTI-Record-Keeping-System/tree/master).
It is developed with Java Netbeans. I applied OOP with super and subclasses besides instantiating objects and carrying them to other frames.
The database for this project is added in another repo called [GTI-Record-Keeping-System-DB](https://github.com/CaglarCetinceviz/GTI-Record-Keeping-System-DB)
When you run the Java system, you will need the database. You can download it from this [link](https://github.com/CaglarCetinceviz/GTI-Record-Keeping-System-DB).
To log in to the system, you must choose the admin or teacher option. In order to do that.
You can create a new admin or teacher in the database, or you can use the info below.
To log in as an admin, please use the email address **_bigboss@gretb.ie_** and the password **_admin123_**.
To log in as a teacher, please use the email address **_mark.shaw@gretb.ie_** and the password **_mark123_**.
