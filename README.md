# GTI - Record Keeping System
This repo contains my graduation project for GTI Advanced Software Development, you can make the pull requests from the [master branch](https://github.com/CaglarCetinceviz/GTI-Record-Keeping-System/tree/master).

It is developed with Java Netbeans. I applied OOP with super and subclasses besides instantiating objects and carrying them to other frames.

Before you try to run the system, make sure you have downloaded [Itext5](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.itextpdf/itextpdf/5.5.13.4), [Itext7](https://github.com/itext/itext-java), [Connector Library](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/8.2.0/), then add them to the libraries and **_Clean and Build_** the project.

When you run the Java system, you will need the database.

The database for this project is added in another repo called [GTI-Record-Keeping-System-DB](https://github.com/CaglarCetinceviz/GTI-Record-Keeping-System-DB)

To log in to the system, you must choose the admin or teacher option. In order to do that.

You can create a new admin or teacher in the database, or you can use the info below.

To log in as an admin, please use the email address **_bigboss@gretb.ie_** and the password **_admin123_**.

To log in as a teacher, please use the email address **_johndoe@gretb.ie_** and the password **_john123_**.
