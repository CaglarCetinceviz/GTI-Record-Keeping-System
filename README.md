# GTI - Record Keeping System
This repo contains my graduation project for GTI Advanced Software Development. 
It is developed with Java Netbeans. I applied OOP with super and subclasses besides instantiating objects and carrying them to other frames.
The database for this project is added in another repo called [GTI-Record-Keeping-System-DB](https://github.com/CaglarCetinceviz/GTI-Record-Keeping-System-DB)
To log in to the system, you must choose the admin or teacher option. In order to do that.
You can create a new admin or teacher in the database, or you can use the info below.
